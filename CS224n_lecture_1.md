# Linear Algebra
### 1. Outer product
*Column vector* products *Row vecter* gives a matrix, which is called **outer product**.  
*Row vector* products *Column vecter* gives a scalar, which is called **inner product**.

### 2. Matrix-matrix product
*Row* view (left product) and *Column* view (right product).  
Matrix multiplication is **associative**: (AB)C = A(BC).  
Matrix multiplication is **distributive**: A(B+C) = AB + AC. 

### 3. Different matrix types
- Identity matrix: suqare matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros everwhere else. `IA=A, BI=I`
- Diagonal matrix: suqare matrix with all non-diagonal elements are 0. `D=diag(d1, d2, ..., dn)`
- Symmetric matrix: `A^{T} = A`
