# Basic concepts and sample codes about ML and DL

Since famous [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and [Andrew Ng's new DL course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) are both introduce basic concepts about ML and DL, so I combine them together. 

Sample projects list:
- [Vectorized logistic regression](https://github.com/gaoisbest/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-basic-concepts-and-sample-codes/blob/master/Logistic%20regression/Logistic_regression_vectorized.py)
- ...


Classical problem solutions (to be done):
- [Imbalanced training data]()
- [Missing data]()
- [Feature selection]()
- [Evaluation matrics]()
- ...
