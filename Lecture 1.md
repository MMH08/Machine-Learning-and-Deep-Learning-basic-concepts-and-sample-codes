# Basic concepts
- Image classification is a fundamental task for other Computer Vision problems (such as object dection, segmentation or image captioning),
- In computer view, an image is viewed as a 3-D array. For a three color channels (RGB) image with 20 pixels wide, 30 pixels tall, it has a total of
20 * 30 * 3 = 1800 integers. Each integer ranges between 0 (black) and 255 (white).
